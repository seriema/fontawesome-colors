fontawesome-colors
==================

Colors for the Font Awesome icons.

I <3 Font Awesome. I use it for almost all my projects, at work and spare time. Some times I want a color on the icon, that isn't my websites color but just a color you'd expect from that icon. Sure this was mostly for brand icons like Facebook and Twitter. So I set out to color all the icons!

The CSS is in /webpage/css/main.css but that will move.

You can see the result on http://johansson.jp/fontawesome-colors.
